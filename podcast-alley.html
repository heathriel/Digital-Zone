                    <p>
                        Welcome to the wonderful world of podcasting. This is where you will learn everything you need to know about this exciting new trend in medical education!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm Julie Newman, Associate Director in Medical Affairs from Australia and I'm also the creator of the HIV in Podcast. I’ve been helping Gilead teams around the world create podcasts of their own, expanding their audience as they discuss the latest in different therapy areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Listening to medical podcasts and subscribing to medical podcasts are great ways to stay informed. They can help you gain new perspectives and they don't require any shelf space!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recording a medical podcast is even better. You get to meet experts in the therapeutic area and learn about important clinical trends and practices. I highly recommend it!
                        Please explore the resources we offer on this page. Over time, we will be adding more and more, and check back often! Happy podcasting!

                    <h2>What Is A Podcast?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A podcast is a digital audio file made available on the internet for downloading to a computer or mobile device. Podcasts are typically 10–30 minutes long and available as a series. New episodes can be automatically received by subscribers. Podcasts are an engaging and convenient way to deliver medical education because busy professionals can listen to episodes whenever, wherever and how often they like.

                            <li>
                                Try to utilize speakers who may already be speaking at a Gilead event. It is an easy way to share that information more broadly.

                                While you may record for an hour or so, be sure to break up the recording into smaller bits, no more than 10 minutes per segment.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Create a slide announcing the podcasts and include that at Gilead meetings. The podcasts are on-label, so that you can share with your local HCPs.

                                If possible, work with a local medical society to accredit or endorse the podcasts. They are truly excellent examples of medical education!

                                Multichannel communication with HCPs require digital communication consents. The cross-functional team helps obtain these consents to reach a broader audience, which is ongoing in Turkey.

                                Experts suggest releasing new content every 7-10 days; that is why it is essential to have buffer content. Translating Australian podcasts helps to produce buffer content.

                            <li>
                                Having one moderator/presenter hosting different speakers is more achievable than having different hosts.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Contrast within your content and speakers will increase your hit rate. For example, having one very senior and one very junior HCP or one HCP who is very didactic and one who is very practical, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Multichannel promotions of podcasts should be in place, including leave-behind pieces like pamphlets, conference booth promotions, regular emails and feedback requests.
                            </li>

                                It is crucial to localize some generic "terms and conditions" statements with the legal department. These descriptions cover the registration and personal information storage areas for HCPs.
